# SpecRunner
A simple Windows GUI for running nsepcs

If you are into unit testing and have used the NSpec, the only thing you have missed is a tool to run the specs at will. Though we have SpecWatchr (If you are into Continuos testing) and other Test runners that support NSpec, having a separate tool is always welcome. So I decided to create this tool on the steps of NUnit Runner.

## What it does?
* Load one or multiple assembles
* Save the projects for future referencea
* Graphical representation of all the specs 
* Complete error display for failed tests

## How it works
* Open the program and load your assembly containing NSpecs
* Once loaded, select the whole assembly or a single spec
* Run and analyze the results
